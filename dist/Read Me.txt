Exact both the jar and the src folder to the same folder/area.
It can be run using command prompt and java -jar "Maze_Solution.jar" or by double-clicking the jar.

Click on the maze you want to open and hit the 'Open' button.
Click the 'Solve & Output' button to attempt to solve the maze and the solution will be output into a .txt file.

I would have liked to make it much more fancy and visually appealing.
I wanted to add an 'Add' button to allow users to add their own mazes for testing.
I am going to continue to work on it in my free time and hopefully make it shine.
This was created in Eclipse and Netbeans.

Thank you for giving me the chance to try out this challenge.

Kind Regards,

Ciall McArdle.
