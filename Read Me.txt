Exact both the jar and the src folder to the same folder/area.
It can be run using command prompt and java -jar "Maze_Solution.jar" or by double-clicking the jar.

I would have liked to make it much more fancy and visually appealing.
I am going to continue to work on it in my free time and hopefully make it shine.

Thank you for giving me the chance to try out this challenge.

Kind Regards,

Ciall McArdle.
